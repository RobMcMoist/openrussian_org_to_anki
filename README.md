# openrussian_to_anki
Scrape data from openrussian.org and put it into an anki deck

Current status (January, 11th, 2023):

- Add example sentences
- Other word types, full export will probably be linked via another platform, depending on size
- Formatting, general prettiness will come after that

Current status looks as follows:
